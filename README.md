## Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

## About Me
Hello there! I'm Abdul Muizz, a passionate student with a knack for learning and exploring new technologies. I completed my matriculation from **Bahria College Karsaz** and I'm currently pursuing my intermediate education at **DJ Sindh Govt. Science College**. Recently, I delved into the world of programming with Python through **Bano Qabil 2.0** and I'm eager to deepen my knowledge in this field. Alongside Python, I also have a keen interest in Cybersecurity and aspire to become proficient in securing digital systems.

## Skills
- **Programming**: Python
- **Areas of Interest**: Cybersecurity, Web Development
- **Tools**: Git, GitHub

## Projects
Here are a few projects I've worked on:
- [To-do List](https://github.com/AbdulMuizzFayyaz/BanoQabil_2.0_Python_Course/blob/main/To_Do_List.py): Introducing a straightforward "To-Do List" application programmed in Python. This application empowers users to seamlessly manage their tasks, offering functionalities such as adding, viewing, deleting, and marking tasks as complete. All tasks are efficiently stored in a text file for easy access and organization. The program boasts a user-friendly Command Line Interface (CLI), ensuring intuitive interaction with the To-Do List for enhanced productivity.

- [Snake Game](https://github.com/AbdulMuizzFayyaz/BanoQabil_2.0_Python_Course/tree/main/Final%20Project): Experience the thrill of a classic snake game built entirely in Python using the Pygame library. Navigate a growing snake through a maze of fruit, where each consumption increases its length. But beware: touching the boundaries or the snake itself ends the game. Test your reflexes as the challenge escalates with every fruit eaten. Enjoy seamless interaction through a colorful Graphical User Interface (GUI) for an immersive gaming experience.

## What's Next?
I'm continuously expanding my knowledge and skills. Here's what's on my learning roadmap:
- Deepening my understanding of Python by exploring advanced topics such as data analysis, machine learning, and web development frameworks like Django and Flask.
- Diving deeper into Cybersecurity to understand threat detection, ethical hacking, and network security principles.
